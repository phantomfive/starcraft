Sample Output:
Calculates how many units can be created on a single base.
First calculates the number of that unit that can be created, then it
calculates how many buildings you'll need if you want to spend all your
money. Both these tables assume you have six workers mining gas, in addition
to the workers mining minerals.

This is useful because it lets you plan your game, like this:
1) Plan your ideal unit composition
2) Plan what buildings you need to create to get that composition
3) Build the buildings you need as fast as possible
4) Pump out units like a madman
5) Win.
